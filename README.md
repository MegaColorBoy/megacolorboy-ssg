# megacolorboy-ssg: A simple static site generator

My current blog is statically generated using Markdown and I thought
of giving it a revamp by making it more flexible and give it more features
like pagination, archiving, date sort and being able to create new
sections of the blog in no time.

I wanted to flex my Python skills a bit, so thought this would be a good
time to make it work again.

This is an open source project and you are free to read the code or even 
fork it into your own version!

# Things left to do:

- [x] Archive
- [ ] Tags/Categories
- [ ] Bulk import/export
- [ ] Better way to manage templates
- [ ] Makefile to automate deployment / Deployment using Python tools
- [ ] Interactive UI to select and delete posts (Look into something nCurses library)

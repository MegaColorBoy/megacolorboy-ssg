# megacolorboy-ssg: A simple static site generator

My current blog is statically generated using Markdown and I thought
of giving it a revamp by making it more flexible and give it more features
like pagination, archiving, date sort and being able to create new
sections of the blog in no time.

I wanted to flex my Python skills a bit, so thought this would be a good
time to make it work again.

This is an open source project and you are free to read the code or even 
fork it into your own version!

# Things left to do:

- [ ] Resume page
- [ ] Projects page
- [ ] A nice way to manage all static assets (CSS, JS and Images) 
- [x] Minimal blog layout
- [ ] Generate reading time
- [x] Archive (currently supports group by year)
- [x] Merging multiple writings of different sections
- [x] Separate file to preserve configurations
- [x] Tags/Categories
- [ ] Bulk import/export
- [x] Better way to manage templates and themes
- [ ] Makefile to automate deployment / Deployment using Python tools

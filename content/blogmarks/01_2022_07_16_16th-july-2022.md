- [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev) &mdash; A privacy-first, no-nonsense, super-fast blogging platform. Not really needed for me but quite an interesting platform.
- <blockquote>Becoming a good engineer is about collecting experience. Each project, even small ones, is a chance to add new techniques and tools to your toolbox. Where this delivers even more value is when you can solve problems by pairing techniques learned on one project with tools learned working on another. It all adds up. &mdash; <cite>[Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/blog/software-engineering-soft-parts/)</cite></blockquote>
- [Interactive Mechanical Contraption in pure CSS](https://cohost.org/blackle/post/42994-contraption) &mdash; Believe it or not, it's unreal. It doesn't even look like it's done using CSS. Love it! ❤️
- [Defensive CSS](https://defensivecss.dev) &mdash; I came across this site two days ago. I like how Ahmad Shadeed describes different CSS patterns in detail.

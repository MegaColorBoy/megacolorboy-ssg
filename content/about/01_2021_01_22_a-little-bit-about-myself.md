summary: Here's a not-so-formal kind of introduction about myself.

Hello there! My name is Abdush Shakoor and I like problem solving and building stuff for fun!

I'm a full stack software engineer living in Dubai, United Arab Emirates with a passion for Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Digital Design and Technology.

<!-- During the past years, I've done internships with various companies including Oracle Corporation, Dubai. Find out more about my career on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdush-shakoor-mohamed-nazeer-b5546546) profile. -->

<!-- As of **October 2019**, I'm looking for **better opportunities** to expand my programming and skills, so if you're a recruiter/well-wisher and interested in me, send me an [email](mailto:abdushshakoor1992@hotmail.com) about it.

My last job was at [Key Information Technology](https://www.kit.ae) in which I was building the company's website and productive tools for teams. Find out more about my career on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdush-shakoor-mohamed-nazeer-b5546546) profile. -->

Currently, I work at [Planet Green Solutions](https://www.pgsuae.com) as a Backend Engineer who develops web applications for various clients that mostly comprises of various Government Entities of the United Arab Emirates.

Oh, I'm also part of the Backend team that helped build [FarmsGate](https://www.farmsgate.com), an eCommerce platform for farmers that can sell and deliver fresh fruits and vegetables to your doorstep!

In my spare time, I love to tinker with my computer science and software engineering projects like implementing new algorithms, learning new programming languages or paradigms, building a game and so on. I also design conceptual user interfaces after being exposed to the [DailyUI](https://dailyui.co) project.

In fact, this blog is built from scratch. No bootstrap, no heavy UI frameworks or libraries are used as I found it quite unnecessary for a minimalist blog.

    <h3>Blog engine updated!</h3>
    <p>As of March 1st 2019, I have changed my blog engine from a dynamic website to a custom-built static site generator. <a href="../writings/posts/say-hello-new-blog/">Read more &rarr;</a></p>

I'm an intermediate-level toss juggler and I love to spend time practicing my juggling skills. Apart from that, I practice calisthenics, read books and listen to instrumental music.

Illustrating artworks used to be a part of my life, but now it has become one of my hobbies as well. You can view my artworks on my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/abdushshakoor) profile.

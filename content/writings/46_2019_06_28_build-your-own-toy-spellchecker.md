summary: Wrote a simple toy spellchecker using C++ by taking inspiration from Peter Norvig's article.

Spellcheckers and autocorrect, aren't they magical? They do feel like magic to me. I mean, how is it able to predict what word do you want to type?

According to [Norvig](https://norvig.com), some of the most talented engineers at Google don't have a complete understanding of how a spellchecker works.

Peter Norvig's [solution in Python](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) is so elegant and simple, I don't think anyone can write better than that. However, I wanted to know how it works, so I thought of building it to understand it's functionality. Also, an excuse to exercise my C++ skills.

So, are you as curious as I am? If you are, I think you're in the right spot.

## How it works?
Okay, so think about it? What does a spellchecker do? You type in a misspelled word and it returns a word with the highest probability, right? 

Well, there's a little bit more to it.

### Create a word dictionary

First, we must create a dictionary, in order to do that, you need to extract words from a large piece of text and store it in a Hashmap in which each word will have a word count. In this example, I've used a Sherlock Holmes novel (which is around 6MB). The words are extracted from a novel instead of an actual dictionary because it can be used to create a simple Language Model.

**Source code to create a dictionary:**
<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
    void SpellChecker::extractWords(string &filename)
    {
        ifstream infile;
        infile.open(filename);
        string x;
        while(infile &gt;&gt; x)
        {
            x = filterAlpha(x);
            dictionary[x]++;
        }
    }

    string SpellChecker::filterAlpha(string &word)
    {
        for(int i=0; i&lt;word.size(); i++)
        {
            char ch = word[i];

            if(ch &lt; 0)
            {
                word[i] = '-';
            }

            if(isalpha(ch))
            {
                word[i] = tolower(ch);
            }
        }

        return word;
    }
    </code>
</pre>

### Create a list of candidates

Second, we must able to predict/hypothesize the ways of editing text when the user types. It could be one of the following types of editing:

- [Adding a letter](#inserts)
- [Replacing a letter](#replaces)
- [Switching two adjacent letters](#transposes)
- [Removing a letter](#deletes)

Based on the types of edits a user could make, we can generate a list of possible candidates by creating permutations using these edit methods mentioned above.

#### <a id="inserts"></a> Adding a letter

In this method, you generate a list of candidates by inserting a letter in every iteration.

<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
    void SpellChecker::inserts(string &word, Vector &result)
    {
        for(int i=0; i&lt;word.size()+1; i++)
        {
            for(int j=0; j&lt;alphabets.size(); j++)
            {
                char ch = alphabets[j];
                result.push_back(word.substr(0,i) + ch + word.substr(i));
            }
        }
    }
    </code>
</pre>

#### <a id="replaces"></a> Replacing a letter

In this method, you generate a list of candidates by replacing each character with a letter from a list of alphabets in every iteration.

<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
    void SpellChecker::replaces(string &word, Vector &result)
    {
        for(int i=0; i&lt;word.size(); i++)
        {
            for(int j=0; j&lt;alphabets.size(); j++)
            {
                char ch = alphabets[j];
                result.push_back(word.substr(0,i) + ch + word.substr(i+1));
            }
        }
    }
    </code>
</pre>

#### <a id="transposes"></a> Switching two adjacent letters

In this method, you generate a list of candidates by switcing two adjacent letters in every iteration. For example: the word "ornage" would look like this: "orange", when the letters "n" and "a" are swapped.

<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
    void SpellChecker::transposes(string &word, Vector &result)
    {
        for(int i=0; i&lt;word.size()-1; i++)
        {
            result.push_back(word.substr(0,i) + word[i+1] + word[i] + word.substr(i+2));
        }
    }
    </code>
</pre>

#### <a id="deletes"></a> Removing a letter

In this method, you generate a list of candidates by removing a letter in every iteration.

<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
    void SpellChecker::deletes(string &word, Vector &result)
    {
        for(int i=0; i&lt;word.size(); i++)
        {
            result.push_back(word.substr(0,i) + word.substr(i+1));
        }
    }
    </code>
</pre>

All of these methods are called in one wrapper method:
<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
    void SpellChecker::edits(string &word, Vector &result)
    {
        //Deletion
        deletes(word, result);

        //Transposition
        transposes(word, result);

        //Replacement
        replaces(word, result);

        //Insertion
        inserts(word, result);
    }
    </code>
</pre>

### Extract the known words

Third, at this stage, the above step would've generated a huge list of words but 90% of them would be gibberish, so we need to "clean" the list and extract the known words using the dictionary we've created.

<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
    void SpellChecker::known_words(Vector& results, Dictionary &candidates)
    {
        Dictionary::iterator end = dictionary.end();

        for(int i=0; i&lt;results.size(); i++)
        {
            Dictionary::iterator val = dictionary.find(results[i]);

            if(val != end)
            {
                candidates[val->first] = val->second;
            }
        }
    }
    </code>
</pre>

The <mark>edits()</mark> method apply to words that have a edit distance of 1, what if it was 2 or more? Like if the user typed "the", it could've been "then" or "they". So, all you have to do is create a method that generates a new set of permutations based on the already generated list of edited words and extract the known words.

<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
    void SpellChecker::edits2(Vector &result, Dictionary &candidates)
    {
        for(int i=0; i&lt;result.size(); i++)
        {
            Vector edit2;

            edits(result[i], edit2);
            known_words(edit2, candidates);
        }   
    }
    </code>
</pre>

### Display the correct word

In order to determine the correct word, the following possibilities are considered:

1. Check if this word is in the dictionary, if it does, display it.
2. Generate known words that have an edit distance of 1 and check in the dictionary, if it does, display it.
3. Generate known words that have an edit distance of 2 and check in the dictionary, if it does, display it.
4. If all else fails, this word is unique or not a known word.

<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
    string SpellChecker::correct(string &word)
    {
        Vector result;
        Dictionary candidates;

        string file = "big.txt";

        //1. if it's in the dictionary, display it
        if(dictionary.find(word) != dictionary.end())
        {
            return word;
        }

        extractWords(file);

        edits(word, result);
        known_words(result, candidates);

        //2. if it's a known word but one edit away
        if(candidates.size() &gt; 0)
        {
            return max_element(candidates.begin(), candidates.end())-&gt;first;
        }

        //3. if it's a known word but two edits away
        edits2(result, candidates);

        if(candidates.size() &gt; 0)
        {
            return max_element(candidates.begin(), candidates.end())-&gt;first;
        }

        //4. Display nothing if it doesn't exist
        return "This word doesn't exist!";
    }
    </code>
</pre>

However, for conditions 2 and 3, the word displayed would most likely have the highest word frequency in the dictionary.

## Conclusion
Phew! I hope that wasn't a long read. Although, I've written this on C++, I plan to rewrite this on Javascript for some of my future projects.

To be honest, I don't think it's completely accurate, although, I got most of the words correct when tested.

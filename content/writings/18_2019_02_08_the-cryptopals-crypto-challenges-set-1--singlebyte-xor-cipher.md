category: Cryptography
summary: Write a method that decrypts a hexadecimal message that has been XOR'd against a single character.

This is the [third challenge](http://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/3)
of Set 1 in The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges website. Previously, I
spoke about these challenges and provided walkthroughs for the previous
challenges, if you haven't read them, here are the links:

For this challenge, you have to write a method that decodes a
Hexadecimal string:

<pre>
    <code class="plaintext">
    1b37373331363f78151b7f2b783431333d78397828372d363c78373e783a393b3736
    </code>
</pre>

That has been ***XOR'd*** against a ***single character***. You must find
the key and decrypt the message.

If you have read the [previous
article](/posts/the-cryptopals-crypto-challenges-set-1--fixed-xor),
it was clearly setup for this problem. There are so many ways to solve
this problem but the most efficient way to solve it is by using a
***Frequency table***.

Assuming the message is supposed to be in English, when decrypted, we
need to only generate a frequency table using the given Hexadecimal
string that shows the frequencies of each ***alphabet***. The character
that has the highest frequency is the key required, which is then used
to perform an ***XOR (\^)*** operation against each character, to decrypt
the encrypted message.

Let's have a look at the code:

<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
    //Return Character frequency of a string
    map&lt;char, int&gt; CryptoLib::frequency_table(string str)
    {
        map&lt;char, int&gt; m;
        map&lt;char, int&gt;::iterator it;

        for(int i=0; i&lt;str.size(); i++)
        {
            char ch = str[i];
            it = m.find(ch);

            if(it == m.end())
            {
                m.insert(make_pair(ch,1));
            }
            else
            {
                it->second++;
            }
        }

        return m;
    }

    //Return character with the highest frequency
    char CryptoLib::ret_high_freq_char(map&lt;char, int&gt; m)
    {
        int max_count = 0;
        char max_char;

        for(auto p: m)
        {
            if(isalpha(p.first))
            {
                if(p.second > max_count)
                {
                    max_char = p.first;
                    max_count = p.second;
                }
            }
        }
        return max_char;
    }

    //Single Byte XOR
    string CryptoLib::singleByteXOR(string str)
    {
        string newStr = "";

        //1. Convert Hexadecimal to Binary
        str = add_spaces(con_hex_2_bin(str), 8);

        //2. Convert Binary to Decimals
        vector&lt;int&gt; v = con_bin_2_dec(str, 7.0);

        /*
            What's happening here?
            4. Generate a frequency table using the characters from the ASCII string
            5. Look for characters that are English and also has the highest frequency
            6. The character that has the highest frequency is the KEY!
        */

        //The key
        unsigned char a = toupper(ret_high_freq_char(frequency_table(con_dec_2_ascii(v))));

        //7. Perform XOR with the KEY against each character
        for(int i=0; i&lt;v.size(); i++)
        {
            unsigned char b = v[i];
            unsigned char c = b ^ a;
            newStr += c;
        }

        //8. Decoded message
        return newStr;
    }
    </code>
</pre>

**Final code:**

<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
    //CryptoPals Set 1 Challenge 3
    #include "crypto.h"

    int main()
    {
        CryptoLib crypt;

        //Test case provided
        string str = "1b37373331363f78151b7f2b783431333d78397828372d363c78373e783a393b3736";
        cout << "DECODED: " << crypt.singleByteXOR(str) << endl;
        return 0;
    }   
    </code>
</pre>

**Decrypted message:**

<pre>
    <code class="plaintext">
    Key with the highest frequency: 'X'
    Message: Cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
    </code>
</pre>

***Note: This solution and the library named <mark>crypto.h</mark> was
built using the C++ programming language. The source code for this
solution can be found on Github.***

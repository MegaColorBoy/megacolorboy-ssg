summary: A blog post about codes and ciphers.

During this week, I was thinking about writing a very long blog post about Cryptography but then it would be too long for the readers that it might get them to feel bored. So, for starters, I thought about making a series of short blog posts called ***"Let's Cipher This"*** that would focus on the areas of [Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography).

## What is it about?
Well, the aim of this series is that I want to talk about Codes (I meant secret ***"codes"***) and [Ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher), such as:

+ How they both work
+ How can they both be used to encrypt/decrypt messages
+ How to use different methods/strategies to break intercepted code

## What's next?
I know that there are a lot of simple and complex ciphers/crypto algorithmic techniques out there and I wanted to make each post as informative and interactive as possible i.e. by giving a detailed description about the cipher/technique, it's history, how it works and it's implementation, which can also be used as a tool for encrypting/decrypting your own messages.

The series is going to be a ***"Work in Progress"***, so there won't be an ending to it as the field of the Cryptography is quite vast, deep and complex. I will be updating this series as often as I can, so watch out for new posts that are related to it!

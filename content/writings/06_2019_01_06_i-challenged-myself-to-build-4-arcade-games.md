summary: I challenged myself to build four arcade games during this month. Hope you'll enjoy reading this article.

Alas! It has been a long time since my last blog post.

Last month was the Holy Month of Ramadan, so I kept myself busy with my religious duties and it also kind of ruined my sleeping pattern, thus I was tired to post anything. Since I was pretty exhausted after that, I decided to take a week off from work to spend some time with my family and also thought of working on my side projects and then I realized that I need to set a personal challenge to get myself motivated for the month.

## What's the challenge?
When I was building this blog, I had the intention of remaking arcade games and posting them over here for the visitors to come and play them! So since I had a week off from work, I challenged myself to build four arcade games this month and create a separate blog post for each game, where I would be talking about how it was built, it's history and it's game mechanics.

These are the list of games that I had planned to build/already built during this month:

+ Snake
+ Breakout
+ Pong
+ Tetris

## How did the challenge feel?
Honestly, it was really refreshing and felt like a mini-hackathon. I was able to learn new things about ***Game Programming*** and ***2D Mathematics*** and as a result, I have upgraded my knowledge on ***Javascript*** as well. Although I told myself that I would build all of these games in a month, during my time off, I was able to build everything except ***Tetris*** as I'm still working on it. 

## What's next?
I know this is a short post but I'm working on the content for each blog post, so that it doesn't feel rushed! Once I have posted all of them, I'd like to know your views on each of them and it would be also nice if you could suggest any arcade games that I could remake!

Until next time, then!

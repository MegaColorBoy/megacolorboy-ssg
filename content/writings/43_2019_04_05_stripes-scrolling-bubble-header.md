If you're a UI/UX developer, you've probably heard about [Stripe.com](https://www.stripe.com) and their uses of motion and design with their targeted audience in mind.

As I was exploring their website, I discovered their [customers](https://stripe.com/customers) page and instantly, I was intrigued by their smooth scrolling bubble header and the concept was interesting enought that it caught my attention.

In this article, I'll explain on how I had attempted to recreate their scrolling bubble header.

## Analysis
The mechanics are pretty simple to understand, these are the following:

- The bubbles are randomly generated and placed on page load
- Smooth animation of the up and down movements
- Infinite animation loop

A trivial problem, isn't it? Time to see if we can recreate it!

## Step 1: Create the bubble
Let's write the CSS to create a simple bubble with a <mark>width</mark> and <mark>height</mark> of 150px and by giving it a <mark>border-radius</mark> of 50%.

```css
    .stripe-bubble
    {
        width: 150px;
        height: 150px;
        border-radius: 50%;
    }
```

As for the logo, I inspected their code and figured out that Stripe combined all of their customer logos into a single image, also known as, CSS Spritesheet.

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.stripe.com/img/v3/customers/logos/header-logos.png"/>
</figure>

Performance-wise, it's a clever technique used to reduce the number of HTTP requests that your internet browser has to make on every page request.

Let's give the CSS spritesheet as a background-image property and adjust it enough to fit the size of one bubble.

```css
    .stripe-bubble
    {
        position: absolute;
        width: 150px;
        height: 150px;
        border-radius: 50%;
        background-image: url('https://www.stripe.com/img/v3/customers/logos/header-logos.png');
        box-shadow: 0 15px 35px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 3px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
        background-size: 1076px 1076px;
    }
```

There are about 43 logos, which means you'll have to create different logos by adjusting the background position property.

```css
    .logo-1
    {
        background-position: 0 0;
    }

    .logo-2
    {
        background-position: 0 -154px;
    }

    .logo-3
    {
        background-position: 0 -308px;
    }
    ...
```

In the next step, using JavaScript, we'll create the classes for the bubbles and the header.

## Step 2: Create a class for Bubble

Before we get in deep, let's create the foundation for our code, so that it'll make things neat and tidy and easier on the go. Below, I have created two classes: one is for the bubble and the other is for the bubble wrapper (no puns):

```js
    class Bubble{
        constructor(){}
        update(){}
    }

    class BubbleMarquee{
        constructor(){}
        update(){}
    }
```

Great, you have created the classes, we can now use these to generate the bubbles dynamically in the next step.

## Step 3: Bubble's scale and position

<figure>
    <img src="/static/images/stripe-bubbles.png"/>
</figure>

As you see in the image above, the logos are randomly placed and scaled. It's clear that there has to be some sort of a pattern, so I decided to take a look into their code:

<figure>
    <img src="/static/images/stripe-bubble-code.png"/>
</figure>

Aha! I discovered that the positioning and scaling of the bubbles are hard-coded and then the logos order are randomly shuffled. I won't be adding a randomizer but for now, let's add the bubbles with it's specifications and respective logos.

```js
    const bubbleSettings = [
        {cssClass:'logo-imgAffirm', s: .6, x: 77, y: 1134 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgAllianz', s: .6, x: 271, y: 1620 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgAmazon ', s: .6, x: 372, y: 1761 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgBookingCom', s: .6, x: 79, y: 2499 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgCatawiki', s: .6, x: 334, y: 2704 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgCityofBoston', s: .6, x: 356, y: 2271 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgDeliveroo', s: .6, x: 226, y: 795 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgDoordash', s: .6, x: 256, y: 276 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgExpedia', s: .6, x: 365, y: 1210 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgFitbit', s: .6, x: 193, y: 444 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgGoogle', s: .6, x: 387, y: 2545 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgIndiegogo', s: .7, x: 193, y: 1303 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgInstacart', s: .7, x: 88, y: 907 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgKickstarter', s: .7, x: 320, y: 633 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgLyft', s: .7, x: 76, y: 323 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgNasdaq', s: .7, x: 357, y: 129 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgNat-Geo ', s: .7, x: 342, y: 1440 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgRackspace', s: .7, x: 293, y: 1929 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgReddit', s: .7, x: 198, y: 2135 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgSalesforce', s: .7, x: 82, y: 2276 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgShopify', s: .7, x: 182, y: 2654 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgSlack', s: .7, x: 75, y: 2783 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgSpotify', s: .7, x: 118, y: 1519 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgSquarespace', s: .7, x: 233, y: 1071 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgTarget', s: .7, x: 148, y: 1773 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgTed', s: .7, x: 385, y: 2098 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgTheGuardian', s: .7, x: 244, y: 2423 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgTwitch', s: .7, x: 385, y: 901 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgUber', s: .7, x: 111, y: 624 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgWeTransfer', s: .7, x: 103, y: 145 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgWish', s: .7, x: 367, y: 413 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgXero', s: .7, x: 251, y: 2805 }, 
        {cssClass:'logo-imgYelp', s: .7, x: 75, y: 1990 }
    ];

    class Bubble {
        constructor(index, {cssClass, x, y, s=.9}){
            this.index = index;
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
            this.scale = s;
            this.cssClass = cssClass;

            this.el = document.createElement("div");
            this.el.className = `stripe-bubble ${this.cssClass}`;

            marqueeEl.appendChild(this.el);
        }

        update(){}
    }

    class BubbleMarquee{
        constructor(settings){
            this.bubbles = [];

            settings.forEach((setting, index) =>{
                this.bubbles.push(new Bubble(index, setting));
            });
        }
        update(){}
    }
```

Okay, now off to animating the bubbles!

## Step 4: Animation
You could use absolute positioning properties like <mark>top</mark> and <mark>left</mark> but it'd be really expensive in terms of calculations, instead of that, you could use <mark>transform</mark> to move the elements.

```js
    this.el.style.transform = `translate(${this.x}px, ${this.y}px) scale(${this.scale})`;
```

As for the animation, you could use <mark>setInterval</mark> but don't do that, stop here and read about [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame).

```js
    constructor(settings){
        this.bubbles = [];

        settings.forEach((setting, index) =>{
            this.bubbles.push(new Bubble(index, setting));
        });

        requestAnimationFrame(this.update.bind(this));
    }

    update(){
        this.bubbles.forEach(bubble => bubble.update());
        this.raf = requestAnimationFrame(this.update.bind(this));
    }
```

Alright, you've done it! It's animating and looks cool but hey, did you notice that there animation doesn't look stale but is more organic-like? That's because they have added some random movement to each bubble.

I took another peek at their code, I found out that they were using [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) to smoothen the animation movements. Unlike, <mark>Math.random()</mark>, I got to know that it's an algorithm used to generate a sequence of randomness that has some order, which helps create a smooth, organic movement.

I didn't implement the algorithm instead I made use of an existing [implementation](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs) written by [Seph Gentle](https://github.com/josephg) found on GitHub.

This is how your <mark>update()</mark> method should look like after adding the Perlin Noise:

```js
    update(){
        this.noiseSeedX += noise_speed;
        this.noiseSeedY += noise_speed;

        var randomXPos = noise.simplex2(this.noiseSeedX, 0);
        var randomYPos = noise.simplex2(this.noiseSeedY, 0);

        this.y -= scrollingSpeed;

        this.xNoisePos = this.x + (randomXPos * noise_amnt); 
        this.yNoisePos = this.y + (randomYPos * noise_amnt); 

        if(this.y < -500)
        {
            this.y = canvas_width;
        }

        this.el.style.transform = `translate(${this.xNoisePos}px, ${this.yNoisePos}px) scale(${this.scale})`;
    }
```

After adding that, you have finally achieved what you wanted! Oh, you can find the source code for this project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/MegaColorBoy/BlogProjects/tree/master/stripe-bubbles) repository.

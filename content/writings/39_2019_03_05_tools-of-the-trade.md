summary: The tools that I use daily for work and personal uses.

In our daily life, the tools we use do matter a lot, they help us solve problems, learn new things and complete our tasks. I usually read blogs of other programmers as well, by doing so, I get to learn about the different technologies and products they use and ultimately, it has helped me take inspiration to change myself too.

I thought of writing an article about the tools that I use on a regular basis, so here we go!

## Hardware
+ [iPhone 5s](#iphone-5s)
+ [Dell XPS 13 9360](#dell-xps-13)
+ [Apple earphones](#apple-earphones)

### <a id="iphone-5s"></a> iPhone 5s

I used to have a ***Samsung Galaxy Pocket***, it was a really slow phone that made me hate Android OS. When I got the iPhone 5s, I never turned back. Not that I'm an Apple fanboy (Well, yes I am) but I believe it is one of Apple's best iPhones till date. The build quality is great. It's still one of those iPhones that has a headphone jack and also, it has a really nice form factor.

### <a id="dell-xps-13"></a> Dell XPS 13 9360

Before purchasing this laptop, I was going to buy a 13" MacBook Pro 2017 but the internet convinced me that it might not be the right choice as it had a lot of flaws like the unresponsive butterfly keyboard, less ports and in terms of specs, it was a bit outdated.

So I thought of going for my next choice with the following specs:

+ Intel i7 @ 2.4Ghz 7th Generation
+ 256GB Solid State Drive
+ 8GB RAM
+ 13.3" Inch FHD Display

It came with a bloated Windows 10 and then later, I replaced it with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, [you can read about it here](/posts/goodbye-windows-10/).

The laptop is very lightweight and portable. It has a really, really good display that is equivalent to the infamous Apple's Retina Display. Thanks to the specs, it runs really fast and I use it primarily for developing software.

If you are planning on getting one, I do recommend it!

### <a id="apple-earphones"></a> Apple earphones

<!-- <figure>

I got these earphones with my iPhone 5s, the sound quality is pretty decent and yes, it portable enough for me to listen to my favorite soundtracks on the go.

## Software
+ [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](#ubuntu)
+ [Sublime Text 3](#sublime)
+ [VIM](#vim)
+ [Terminal](#terminal)
+ [Spotify](#spotify)
+ [XAMPP Control Panel](#xampp)
+ [Google Chrome](#chrome)
+ [Git](#git)
+ [Adobe Illustrator](#ai)
+ [Figma](#figma)

### <a id="ubuntu"></a> Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

I don't hate Windows, in fact, I do use it at work and for graphic design and entertainment purposes but I personally like using Linux as my development environment.

I chose Ubuntu because it has a strong community and compared to other distributions, it has good support for Dell XPS hardware.

Apart from that I've got three more things to say: Open source. Secure and Developer-Friendly.

### <a id="sublime"></a> Sublime Text 3

<figure>

I have been using Sublime Text since my university days, it's still one of my favorite text editors that I use at home and work. It has really good features such as:

+ Powerful keyboard shortcuts
+ Lightweight
+ Fast startup
+ Good selection of themes and configurable
+ Able to edit multiple lines at the same time

Oh, I wrote this article on Sublime Text!

### <a id="vim"></a> VIM

<figure>

</figure>

I read a lot of people talking about it and I thought giving it a shot to explore VIM and I must say, it's really a game changer.

Although, it's not an IDE like ***Emacs*** but it's quite a powerful text editor. It has really powerful keyboard shortcuts, it's configurable and it's quite handy if you wanted to edit any file on the terminal.

### <a id="terminal"></a> Terminal

<figure>

</figure>

Ahh, the terminal. The application that people instantly assumes that it's used for hacking. Well no, it's not only used for hacking.

Yes, it's cool to use and know the command-line but I use it to automate my tasks using Bash, SSH, updates and upgrades using apt-get, downloading packages and software, editing text using VIM and much more.

### <a id="spotify"></a> Spotify

<figure>

Spotify wasn't available in the United Arab Emirates until November 2018. I use it during my coding sessions to stay focused. I'm a free user but I get to listen to all my favorite tracks. The AI recommended playlists are pretty cool too!

### <a id="xampp"></a> XAMPP Control Panel

<figure>
    <img src="https://undsgn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/XAMPP-3.jpg"/>
</figure>

Whenever I'm developing a PHP + MySQL web application, I use this as it comes with the Apache server. If you're using it on Linux, you might have to spend some time configuring the user access permissions.

### <a id="chrome"></a> Google Chrome

<figure>

My preferred browser and I use it everyday. I love using the Inspect tool to debug JavaScript and CSS code.

It has good extensions for daily use:

+ Adblock 
+ Postman
+ React Developer Tools
+ Amino: Live CSS Editor

And yes, it does have a huge appetite for your RAM!

### <a id="git"></a> Git

<figure>
    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QoR3rxWIbnf5wmF_IuAHqQ.png"/>
</figure>

I have heard of a lot of systems but using Git for code versioning and source control is pretty helpful especially if you want to host your projects or maintain your code portfolio on ***GitHub***.

### <a id="ai"></a> Adobe Illustrator

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/adobe-illustrator-cc/9780134664217/images/fmfig03.jpg"/>
</figure>

I have been using it since I was 15 years old, I remember that one of first vector art was a gas mask and from there, I taught myself how to use different tools like the Pen Tool, the Shape Builder and much more. I don't think that there can be anyone that can top Illustrator in the Digital Design industry.

### <a id="figma"></a> Figma

<figure>

</figure>

When I was worried that ***Sketch*** is not available on Linux or Windows, I discovered Figma. It's one of the best UI tools that I have ever used. It helped me build my UI/UX skills really quick and I felt really comfortable designing user interfaces and components before actually coding it.

## Conclusion
Just to make a note, these are my essential tools and this article is not intended to change your mind, your mileage can vary.

Hope you guys liked reading this article!

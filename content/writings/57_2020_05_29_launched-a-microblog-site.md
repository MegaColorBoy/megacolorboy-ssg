summary: A tiny experiment to see how it could improve my writing productivity.
status: active

Ever since I've been working from home (due to COVID19 pandemic), I hardly find time to write any posts on my blog and I felt that it was counter-productive whenever I wanted to start a new one after a long time.

And then, I came across this trend of **TIL** a.k.a **Today I Learned** on GitHub and one of my favorite ones is written by [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/blob/master/README.md).

## What is this about?
Unlike writing long articles, which takes a lot of time, I believe that by having a microblog and writing short articles could help improve my productivity in writing.

So, I thought of sharing whatever I have learned on a day-to-day basis and accumulate this knowledge in a "repository" where anyone could learn from, thus is why I started this microblog. Besides, as of writing this article, I wrote 25 short articles in a month.

## What kind of articles can we expect?
It'd be wonderful to say that I can talk about anything over here but currently, I'm restricting it to Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering and Digital Design.

## So what about your main blog?
Oh, I'm not ignoring it! The main blog will be there but now that I have segregated it, it'll allow me to take some time to plan and write content-heavy articles. There'll be more articles coming in a few months time.

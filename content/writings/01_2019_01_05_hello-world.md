summary: Hello World. This is my first blog post. Hope you'll like my future blog posts!

Hello World! This is my first blog post.

<pre>
	<code class="cpp">
	#include &ltiostream&gt
	int main()
	{
		cout << "Hello World" << endl;
		return 0;
	}
	</code>
</pre>

I'm not a huge fan of open source CMS projects like Wordpress and Drupal, I decided to build my own custom blog engine for talking and discussing about my favorite topics.

For this blog, I aimed for a minimalistic look, hence I decided not to use any templates or CSS frameworks to make it look bloated or fancy.

On using this blogspace of mine, I intend to talk about technology, math, computer science, design, programming experience and a lot of positive stuff.

Hopefully, I will try my best to update this blog as frequently as possible.

Hope you guys will enjoy reading my future blog posts!

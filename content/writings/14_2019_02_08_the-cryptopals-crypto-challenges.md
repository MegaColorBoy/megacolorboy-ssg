summary: Came across an interesting website that hosts cryptographic challenges based on real world cryptography.

Last week, I came across an interesting website named [The Cryptopals
Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/) (also known as The Matasano
Crypto Challenges) that hosts cryptographic challenges based on
real-world cryptography that makes use of various ciphers and secure
protocols.

## What is it about?

These challenges were developed by a security team called [NCC
Security](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/), which is developed as a tool
for teaching [Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography).

Currently, there are eight sets of problems in which each set gets
progressively harder as you solve them. As I'm writing this post, I'm
solving the [first set](http://cryptopals.com/sets/1) of problems, these
problems are designed in such a way that you get to build own
cryptographic functions/utilities and exploit them. Most importantly,
not only do these challenges give you an overview on how to build secure
cryptographic systems but also you'll get an understanding on how
they're being attacked.

In the first few challenges, I was exposed to some crypto math but these
concepts weren't that hard as it was more practical and gentler:

+ [Modular arithmetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic)
+ Working with different bases such as Base 2 and Base 16
+ [Hamming Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)
+ [Standard Deviation and Variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)
+ [Frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_(statistics))

Also, I found myself using different techniques to solve these
challenges such as:

+ String manipulation
+ Lookup tables / Hashmaps
+ Conversion of string to integer and vice-versa
+ Bitwise operators

Like I had mentioned above, this is also designed as a tool to learn
cryptography, which means you don't really need to have prior knowledge
of cryptography and security. It's all about doing your own research on
various algorithms, implementing the solution and then breaking your own
solution.

## Why do I want to do this?

I found it as a good opportunity to sharpen my C++ programming skills
and learn more about cryptographical theory and it's applications. If
you're curious and passionate enough to solve puzzles, this is your
chance!

## What's next?

I will be posting walkthroughs (on how I solved every problem in each
set) on my blog and also provide solutions to those problems on my
[GitHub](https://www.github.com/megacolorboy) repository.

Stay tuned!

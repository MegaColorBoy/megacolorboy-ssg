title: The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges: Set 1 - Detect Single-Character XOR
date: December 13th, 2017
slug: the-cryptopals-crypto-challenges-set-1--detect-singlecharacter-xor
category: Cryptography
summary: Write a method that derives which string that has a length of 60 characters has been encrypted using Single-Byte XOR cipher.

This is the [fourth
challenge](http://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/4) of Set 1 in The
Cryptopals Crypto Challenges website. Previously, I spoke about these
challenges and provided walkthroughs for the previous challenges, if you
haven't read them, here are the links:

    Cipher](/posts/the-cryptopals-crypto-challenges-set-1--singlebyte-xor-cipher)

For this challenge, given a
[list](http://cryptopals.com/static/challenge-data/4.txt) of encrypted
strings, you must derive which string (that has a length of 60
characters) is encrypted using ***Single-Byte XOR Cipher***.

Similar to the [previous
post](/posts/the-cryptopals-crypto-challenges-set-1--singlebyte-xor-cipher),
this is more about breaking the ***Single-Byte XOR Cipher*** technique.
Remember, you can solve this challenge only if you were able to solve
the previous challenge because you'll have to tweak some of the previous
code in this challenge.

## How to detect Single-Byte XOR?

In the previous challenge, we're able to determine the key as we had one
string but how do we do that with 300+ strings in a file except now that
we also have to determine if the string is encrypted using ***Single-Byte
XOR Cipher*** or not?

Here's comes the interesting part:

1.  Select the string that has the most english letters from the file
2.  Perform a Brute-force XOR on the string with the most english
    letters in which each character is XOR'd against every character
    from the ASCII table (256 characters)
3.  Pick the most english string after brute-forcing with each character
4.  Display the final result

Let's have a look at the code:

**Implementation of the method(s):**

<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
    //Return Character frequency of a string
    map&lt;char, int&gt; CryptoLib::frequency_table(string str)
    {
        map&lt;char, int&gt; m;
        map&lt;char, int&gt;::iterator it;

        for(int i=0; i&lt;str.size(); i++)
        {
            char ch = str[i];
            it = m.find(ch);

            if(it == m.end())
            {
                m.insert(make_pair(ch,1));
            }
            else
            {
                it->second++;
            }
        }

        return m;
    }

    //Return integer with the highest frequency of alphabets
    int CryptoLib::high_frequency_count(map&lt;char,int&gt;m)
    {
        int count = 0;
        for(auto p: m)
        {
            if(isalpha(p.first))
            {
                // cout << p.first << ":" << p.second << " ";
                count += p.second;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    //Detect string with Single Byte XOR
    string CryptoLib::detectSingleByteXOR(vector&lt;int&gt; maxV)
    {
        string final = "";
        int maxCount = 0;

        /*
            2. Perform a Brute-force XOR on the string that has
            the most english letters in which each character is XOR'd against
            every character from the ASCII table (256 characters)
        */
        for(int i=0; i&lt;256; i++)
        {
            string temp = "";
            unsigned char a = i;
            for(int j=0; j&lt;maxV.size(); j++)
            {
                unsigned char b = maxV[j];
                unsigned char c = b ^ a;
                temp += tolower(c);
            }

            //3. Select the string that has the most english letters. again.
            int count = high_frequency_count(frequency_table(temp));
            if(count > maxCount)
            {
                maxCount = count;
                final = temp;
            }
        }
        
        //4. Display the most "english" text as the final result
        return final;
    }

**Final code:**

<pre>
    <code class="cpp">
    //Cryptopals Set 1 Challenge 4
    #include "crypto.h"

    int main()
    {
        CryptoLib crypt;

        string str;
        int maxCount = 0;
        string maxString = "";
        vector&lt;int&gt; maxV;

        infile.open("enctext.txt");

        //if the file is not there
        if(!infile)
        {
            cout << "Unable to open the file";
            exit(1);
        }

                int count = crypt.high_frequency_count(crypt.frequency_table(newStr));
                if(count > maxCount)

                    maxV = v1;
                } 
            }
        }

        //2. Pass the list of decimals to the function (for now)
        cout << crypt.detectSingleByteXOR(maxV) << endl;
        return 0;

I've never played Poker and don't think I ever will because I'm not a fan of gambling and placing bets. However, I ran into an interesting problem on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=54) that led me to write a poker hand analyser to determine the rank of each hand.

Before writing this article, I didn't know anything about cards or Poker, I had to do some research on Wikipedia about it. So, forgive me if there's any information that's not accurate in the article.

## Poker Hands
From what I had understood, a ***hand*** is a set of five cards and each card has a rank, which is in the order shown below:

<pre>
    <code class="plaintext">
    Cards are valued in the order of lowest to highest (Left to Right):
    2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace
    </code>
</pre>

Based on the card pattern formed in each hand, the ranking category is determined and it's ranked within it's category based on the ranks of it's cards.

## Hand Ranking Categories

In Poker, there are about 10 ranking categories from lowest to highest:

- [High Card](#highcard)
- [One Pair](#onepair)
- [Two Pairs](#twopairs)
- [Three of a Kind](#threeofakind)
- [Straight](#straight)
- [Flush](#flush)
- [Full House](#fullhouse)
- [Four of a Kind](#fourofakind)
- [Straight Flush](#straightflush)
- [Royal Flush](#royalflush)

Before diving into the code snippets, I wrote a library named [poker_lib.py](https://github.com/megacolorboy/ProjectEuler/blob/master/poker_lib.py) which contains all the methods used in the code snippets.

To make things simple, I created a class named ***Card*** that has two attributes, ***face*** and ***suit***, with ***namedtuple()*** as it's datatype.

### <a id="highcard"></a> High Card

<figure style="text-align: left;">
    <div class="playing_card king_diamonds"></div>
    <div class="playing_card queen_diamonds"></div>
    <div class="playing_card seven_spades"></div>
    <div class="playing_card four_spades"></div>
    <div class="playing_card three_hearts"></div>
</figure>

This hand contains no pairs and it doesn't fall into any other category.

<pre>
    <code class="python">
    def high_card(hand):
        # collect all faces from each card
        allfaces = [f for f,s in hand]

        #sort the faces and show the highest card
        return "high_card", sorted(allfaces, key=lambda f: allfaces.index(f), reverse=True)[0]
    </code>
</pre>

### <a id="onepair"></a> One Pair

<figure style="text-align: left;">
    <div class="playing_card ten_spades"></div>
    <div class="playing_card ten_hearts"></div>
    <div class="playing_card eight_spades"></div>
    <div class="playing_card seven_hearts"></div>
    <div class="playing_card four_clubs"></div>
</figure>

This hand contains two cards of one rank and three cards of three other ranks.

<pre>
    <code class="python">
    def one_pair(hand):
        allfaces = [f for f,s in hand]
        allftypes = set(allfaces)

        # collect pairs
        pairs = [f for f in allftypes if allfaces.count(f) == 2]

        # if there's more than one pair
        if len(pairs) != 1:
            return False

        allftypes.remove(pairs[0])
        return 'one-pair', pairs + sorted(allftypes, key=lambda f: face.index(f), reverse=True)
    </code>
</pre>

        allftypes = set(allfaces)
        
        # collect pairs
        pairs = [f for f in allftypes if allfaces.count(f) == 2]
        
        # if there are more than two pairs
        if len(pairs) != 2:
            return False

        p1, p2 = pairs
        # get the difference using sets
        other_cards = [(allftypes - set(pairs)).pop()]
        return 'two-pair', pairs + other_cards if(face.index(p1) > face.index(p2)) else pairs[::-1] + other_cards
    </code>

## Conclusion
It was a fun project to work on and I learnt new styles of array and string manipulation techniques using Python.

Inspired by this, I'm planning to create an interactive version of this project using Javascript and talk about it on another article.

The code for this program can be found in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MegaColorBoy/ProjectEuler).

Hope you liked reading this article!

Stay tuned for more!

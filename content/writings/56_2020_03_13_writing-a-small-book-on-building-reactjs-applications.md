summary: I'm challenging myself to write a book on how to build simple applications using ReactJS

Over the past few months, I've been spending some of my free time to learn ReactJS and I've got to say, I really like it and got a hang of it after lots of trials and errors.

Just to make it clear, I didn't become a ReactJS expert or something but I figured that writing a book on something that you've learnt would help you understand the material much more deeper.

And since I do believe in it, I decided to challenge myself to write a book on it.

## What's the aim of the book?
I aim to cover the fundamentals and concepts of ReactJS using a progressive and an example-driven approach. You know like on how to write reusable UI components, handle user events and interactions and managing state and props of a component.

By the end of this book, the reader will have solid understanding of React's concepts and be able to build cool applications using it.

## When's it going to be released?
Honestly, I didn't plan on the size of the book yet but the practical content for it i.e. the actual code and applications are ready. I aim to release it somewhere around **late April 2020**.

## Are you planning to monetize it?
Umm, nope! I believe that knowledge should be accessible for everyone and I plan on making the book open source, so that it can get updated as per the latest changes.

## Conclusion
I know it's a short article but I feel like I wanted to challenge myself with a small goal for this year.

Let's see how it goes!

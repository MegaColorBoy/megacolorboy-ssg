Ten days ago, I launched a new makeover for the blog and I felt that it needed a little bit of a colorful yet unique touch.

Recently, I started playing around with the concept of Generative Art and have been studying a lot of about various patterns like:

- Bauhaus
- Truchet Tiles
- Piet Mondrian

So, I thought of writing a new pattern generator using CSS and JavaScript that would assign each article a unique, colorful pattern. Though, it's not yet quite complete, I would consider it to be an experimental feature to see if it goes well with the site.

What do you think about it? Does it look good? What kind of patterns should I add to my generator?

Interested on how it's implemented? Have a look at the [source code](/static/js/art.js).

Hope you found this article to be inspiring!

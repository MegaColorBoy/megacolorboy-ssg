Life is full of surprises, isn't it?

We can't state what could possibly happen in the future based on the
present events. It's like a pattern but except you don't know what it
would turn to be in the end.

This is what the Cambridge Mathematician [John H.
Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) must have
thought about when he invented the **Game of Life**, who was really
interested in [Cellular
Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton), a field of
mathematical research, that is often used in the earlier days to
simulate systems in real world scenario.

His work was influenced by Hungarian-American Mathematician [John von
Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann), who aimed to
build a machine that had the ability to self-replicate itself and thus,
Conway became successful when he was able to simplify Neumann's ideas
using a mathematical model that he had discovered.

I'd like to share a quote that I found really inspiring:

> "You know, people think mathematics is complicated. Mathematics is the
> simple bit. Its the stuff we can understand. Its cats that are
> complicated. I mean, what is it in those little molecules and stuff
> that make one cat behave differently than another, or that make a cat?
> And how do you define a cat? I have no idea." - John H. Conway

## What is Game of Life?

It's a zero-player game on a two-dimensional grid of squares that has no
winners or losers except a certain set of simple mathematical rules that
achieves an unpredictable behavior of whether a pattern (or population)
will die, become stable or grow out of control.

According to the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) article, these are the following rules:

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused
    by underpopulation.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next
    generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by
    overpopulation.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three neighbours becomes a live cell, as
    if by reproduction.

This is one of the simplest examples of a ***self-organizing*** system. I
find it really interesting as how unique yet different patterns emerge
from a simple set of rules and might be considered as a form of
***mathematical beauty***. However, did this help mathematicians or
scientists to understand the diversity of life that has evolved on
earth? Perhaps, but I do believe that ***Mother Nature*** is far more
complicated than that. However, it did help me realize that I have to
study and understand different patterns and behaviours in order to build
complex systems.

Studying the behavior of cells or animals using a simple set of rules
can help understand how things really work and this influences
scientists and engineers to come up with brilliant solutions to solve
existing problems in this world.

For example, studying the intelligent behavior of ants being able to
build complex ant colonies, trying to understand the cause of traffic
congestions and how to prevent them (which I will be talking about in
another post), finding the cure for cancer and many other human diseases
and so on.

Well, the point that I'm trying to make is, perhaps, the solution to all
of today's current problems could be hidden inside the patterns of this
simple game.

Hope you enjoyed reading this article!

Adios Amigo!

This is [Part 1](#) of the three-part series of my first trip to Europe in which I'll be sharing about my experiences.

## Day Zero: November 30th, 2022:

### Dubai âœˆ Amsterdam

It was around 14.35 along with my team lead and united with my colleagues at the Transavia Airlines Check-In at Dubai International Airport Terminal 2. There was a lot of rush at the airport as it's the beginning of the four-day UAE National Day holidays, so I guess, a lot of people made plans for a short vacations.

Right after I checked in, we went through the security checkpoint and then, we had nothing else to do other than sitting at the benches or exploring at the Dubai Duty Free until we board the flight at 18.00.

It's my first time travelling from Dubai International Airport Terminal 2 and it was quite a small aiport but I like smaller aiports because you get to walk less ðŸ¤­.

<!-- Bus video to airplane -->

It was quite exciting to board on the flight and especially, it was fun to travel with my colleagues as we were having fun and joking around.

<!-- Pictures inside the plane -->
The flight was a medium-sized Boeing 737-800 and I love the engine sound of all Boeing airplanes. The duration of the flight was around 9 hours including 30 minute stopover at [Budapest, Hungary](#) for short fuel refuelling. Quite a long flight though.

During the flight, I was standing, listening to my Spotify playlist, sleeping for a while, re-watching [Top Gun: Maverick](#) and began reading the infamous [Masters of Doom](#) book that was about John Carmack and the development of [Doom](#).


### Arriving at Schipol airport

<!-- First photo outside the plane -->

It was around 23.30 (GMT +3) when we landed at Schipol Airport, Amsterdam via [Transavia Airlines](#) from [Dubai, United Arab Emirates](#). As I got off the airplane, the first thing that struck my nose was the smell of marijuana ðŸ‘€.

After all, Amsterdam is known for legalizing the consumption of Marijuana and the famous Red Light districts (No, I won't be covering any of that in this series at all as I feel that there are enough articles about that on the internet).

The airport was pretty quiet as I was walking towards the Immigration Counter. The temperature was about 2 degree celsius and at this point, I wasn't able to feel the freezing temperature as the airport had their heaters on.

The immigration counter didn't have a lot of crowd and I waited for about 10-15 minutes max.

At the Immigration Counter, the Officer inquired me about my visit to Amsterdam:

<!-- PHOTOS OF AIRPORT -->

> Officer: So, what's your purpose of visit?
> 
> 
> Me: Umm, first time to Europe and I'm here to explore Amsterdam.
> 
> Officer: Oh, there's a lot to discover at Amsterdam and you won't be able to cover it within three days.
> 
> Me: Haha, I guess so.
> 
> Officer: Welcome to Amsterdam and enjoy your stay!
> 
> Me: Thanks!
> 

Yes, you can't explore Amsterdam in just three days as there's a lot of discover but hey, since it's my first time, I didn't really mind as I was curious to explore as much as I could.

Right after that, I went along with my team of 18 colleagues to claim my baggage and there was a slight delay on our arrival of baggage, so, we had to wait for about 20 minutes until our baggages arrived.

<!-- PHOTOS OF BAGGAGE COUNTER -->

Collected our baggages and off we go towards the railway station that's connected to the airport, got our train passes and boarded the train to [Amsterdam Centraal Sloterdijk Station](#).

Upon arriving to the station, we were confused on which way to go to the hotel and luckily, there was a local who guided us towards the station exit.

It is, at this point, I felt the really cold temperature of Amsterdam while walking to the hotel, I mean, I'm used to experiencing extreme heat conditions but not cold, so that was different for me.

### Reached the hotel

<!-- Photo of the Hotel -->

We reached the hotel and the receptionist was high on cannabis and ended up mixing our room cards ðŸ˜‚. 

Once I reached the room, I got myself into my night-wear, cooked up some instant ramen with my colleague and went straight to bed.

---

## Day One: December 1st, 2022

Woke up at 6.00 and the skies are still dark because the sun rises at 8.30.

### Breakfast time!

<!-- Breakfast photos -->

Greeted my colleagues and went to serve myself some heavy breakfast.

As for the breakfast, I was a bit skeptical on what would be served for breakfast as I can only eat Halal foods or vegetarian but
fortunately, the hotel served a good breakfast (although, the breakfast menu never changed at all). They had a lot of stuff like:

- Pancakes
- Waffles
- Bacon & Sausages
- Scrambled Eggs
- Smoked Salmon
- Fruits
- Cereals
- Pastries (Muffins, tarts & danishes)
- Smoothies
- Juices

### Off to exploring Amsterdam!

<!-- Video of me spinning around near the hotel -->

Right after breakfast, all of us assembled outside of the hotel and starting taking photos, videos and after sometime, we went to Amsterdam Sloterdijk station to board the train to Amsterdam Centraal Station.

The train station looks really beautiful during daytime and I enjoyed taking some photographs of the station and along with my colleagues.

The waiting period for the train was about 5-7 minutes and we boarded it quickly once it reached the platform.

<!-- Video of the train moving -->

Inside the train was warm and really quiet and many of them were busy getting ready for the day. I wasn't able to click many pictures inside the train as I was mesmerized by the beauty of the cityscapes of Amsterdam.

<!-- Video from Amsterdam Centraal Station -->

Got off the train, exited the station and boy, the combination of the temperature, weather and the people moving around clicking pictures gave it an electrifying vibe. I also did come to know that there are a lot of pick-pocketing cases around Amsterdam but thankfully, we didn't face any such incidents during our trip.

<!-- Some photos of Amsterdam -->

We began strolling around the streets, I was in awe of how good the transportation system is in Amsterdam. I could see less amount of vehicles and I guess, the government encourages their citizens and residents to make use of the public transportation and cycles that are parked around. In fact, there's a dedicated cycle track for cyclists and I guess, you'll find more bicycles than the entire population of Amsterdam.

<!-- Some photos of Amsterdam -->

We walked past the canals and the views were amazing and was quite serene just as the sunlight is peaking around at 11.25am.

<!--  Anne Frank museum crowd -->

We tried to visit Anne Frank's Museum but there was such a long queue, we decided to continue exploring the city.

<!-- photos after leaving anne frank -->

Again, I started to admire the water canals and took more photos of the city. We passed the Rijksmuseum but didn't go inside as many of them weren't interested.

<!-- Food pics -->
Few meters away, we were hungry and parched and we decided to try out some street food. So, I went for large size hotdog and a large size fries, that costed me around 15 euros (AED 58.05), which is quite expensive but for the residents over there, it should be fine, I guess.

There were benches near the eateries, so I took a seat and had my food. It was quite delicious and especially, I love the fries.

<!-- Van gogh museum pictures -->
The famous Van Gogh Museum was a few metres away from the food stalls and we all took some photos outside it. I didn't go inside as I tagged along with the rest of the crowd but however, a colleague visited it and told me that it was quite an experience to visit.

<!-- beer museum photos -->
From there, we went to visit the Heineken Beer Museum, which costed around 21 euros (AED 82.50) per person. I got two coins to get myself some drinks but I don't drink alcohol, so I gave one of it to my colleague and I used the other coin to get myself an orange soda lol.
About the museum, well, I wasn't really interested in it, it could be maybe because that I never drink but the rest of the bunch did enjoy.

<!-- Coming out of the museum photos -->

By now, the skies were getting darker and still the scene was quite beautiful. We decided to stroll around for food and some of them wanted to try out the menu at The Bulldog Cafe (which is known for serving cakes and coffee that's infused with cannabis). I went in along with them to give them some company
but I really couldn't the handle the smell as it made me nauseous, so I decided to go outside and look for interesting eateries around until they were done.

I found a lot of restaurants serving cuisines such as Turkish, Argentine, Indian, Chinese, Japanese and so on. There was a really good restaurant that served steak but was quite expensive, most of my colleagues went in there for dinner and I and two of my other colleagues walked to Burger King that was closer to the steak restaurant. At burger king, I got myself a plant-based whopper burger and I was a bit confused if whether it was really plant-based because it really did taste like beef ðŸ˜†.

<!-- Night video of amsterdam -->
Right after dinner, we did a little more strolling and our legs started to hurt like hell. I did pass by the Red Light district but it really wasn't for me. Some decided to stay and the rest went around strolling. I decided to call it a day and went back to the hotel to take some rest and get ready for the next adventure.

If you've come this far in the article, thank you for reading this article and yes, stay tuned for Part 2!

## Day Two: December 2nd, 2022:

<!--  Photos outside the hotel -->

Woke up at 6.30, got ready to have breakfast and assembled with my colleagues at the reception because it's quite a fun day as we were off to visiting the Christmas Market at [Brussels, Belgium](#), which was around 2.5 hours of road trip.

<!-- Photos of the bus -->

It was a Mercedes Benz Tourrider Coach Bus and given the really cold 2 degree celsius temperature, the bus was quite comfy and warming.

<!-- Videos of the highway and sceneries -->

One thing that I really liked about the Europe is that the road infrastructure is terrific and I really liked it.

<!-- Starbucks pic  -->

We stopped in between for a short break, got myself some a nice large coffee (Not from Starbucks but from a supermarket that next to it :cheeky:) and continued our travel to Brussels, Belgium.

### Hallo, BelgiÃ«!

<!-- Pictures of some church and the bus stop -->

Finally, we arrived at the Centraal Bus Station at Brussels, Belgium and the driver had instructed us to get back to the station by 17.30.

Comparatively, the scene at Belgium was more livelier than at Amsterdam as there was a lot of tourists from various countries such as India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and so on. In fact, I even met a nice old lady from Palestine who gave me a nice rose and I was delighted until she asked me to give her something in return, so I gave her around 5 euros but she was a sweet lady.

We decided to march towards the Christmas Market and man, the place is just so photogenic. So, I was practicing my photography skills by taking some nice photos.

<!-- Photos here -->

As I had mentioned above, the city quite lively like there so many things going on at the same time. Belgium is quite famous for Waffles and Fries and my aim was to try them at least once before I leave.

We saw The Great Belgium Palace and to our surprise, there was a couple getting married when we got there and it was nice seeing the couple waving at the the crowd while they were on top.

<!-- Inside the city videos, photos -->

Walked more inside the city, clicked more pictures and selfies with my colleagues as they are quite keen on good photography as well.

### The Christmas Market

At last, we reached the Christmas Market and for some reason, I had the same feeling when I watched Home Alone 2 when I was a kid. I mean, I don't celebrate Christmas but I can feel those vibes around and I really enjoyed it.

<!-- Waffles  -->
At the market, I tried some really Belgian Waffles made by a nice French lady at small stall. I tried without any syrup or cream and it was absolutely scrumptious. The texture, the smell and the softness of it was quite amazing. Hands down to one of the best waffles I have ever tried.

And then there was this nice potato dish filled with some sort of cheese sauce and topped off with some mushrooms and caramelized onions. At the market, I bought some nice caramelized pecan nuts for about 5 euros and yes, I tried some delicious Belgian fries with the infamous Samuraisauce.

At this point, the temperature started to lower down and touched 1 degree Celsius and got windy too. It was super cold that I couldn't even feel my hands and decided to wear gloves on full-time.

We decided to visit a beer tasting shop which approximately another 1KM by walking. Don't worry, I don't drink, I just gave them some company and thought of browsing the internet for a while until they were done with it. But the vibe inside the shop was quite nice and warming.

<!-- FritzLand picture -->
All of us got hungry and we found a really nice shop that sold really good chicken hotdogs and fries. So, we topped them off with some of that Samurai sauce and caramelized onions. The taste of the sandwiches was quite addictive and I ended up eating like two of those :laugh:.

Bought myself some nice Belgian chocolates that was in packed in bundle of 6 pieces for about 15 euros. 

By then, the time was around 17.00 and all of us decided to reach the bus. Once, I reached the bus, I was relieved as the heaters was on and I felt like a frozen chicken being thawed out in warm water.

At around 21.00, we reached the hotel, some of them decided to hang around by the pubs and I decided to head back to the room as my legs were exhausted by thankfully, unlike the [previous day](#), which was like 3x times the distance covered, I covered around 6.5KM of walking distance.

That night, I decided to try some doner kebab and sharwarma via Uber Eats and watched a little bit of Godzilla (1992) which was dubbed in Dutch :laugh: and right after that, I called it a day and went to sleep like a baby :sleep:.

If you've come this far, thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed reading this post.

Stay tuned for Part 3!

## Day Three: December 3rd, 2022:

In the early eerie dark hours around 5.30, I was awake and I thought of making some calls to my parents and wife to catch up on things and keep them updated about my trip.

I went to have some breakfast in the hotel but turns out most of them weren't even awake yet as they were all exhausted with their late night hangouts.

On this day, we planned to visit a place named Zaanse Schans, which is about 45 minute ride by the public bus. Honestly, I never knew what this place was about until I looked it up on the internet and it was seemed quite interesting. 

At first, we planned to take the train to a station that was closest to the village and from there, we would rent cycles and ride to the village but unfortunately, the weather was too cold (0 degree celsius) and windy that we could barely feel our hands and ears, thus we opted for an alternative i.e. to take a direct bus from the Amsterdam Centraal Station.

The public buses seemed quite familiar to the buses I have travelled in Dubai and as mentioned above, it was about 45 minutes with 10-12 stops in between. The bus was quite warm and the people were quite friendly and often greeted us in Dutch, English or French with a smile on their faces.


## Discovering Zaanse Schans
<!-- Bus stop  of zaanse -->

Alas, we reached the spot and wow, it looks really serene and calming. Leafless trees, golden maple leaves, Siberian ducks and huge windmills are what made the spot really unique.

<!--Leaves/Ducks/Zaanse schans entrance photos  -->

Given that I love taking some nature photos, I spent some time trying to a video of a few ducks taking a dive in the cold waters of Zaanse Schans.

<!-- More cottages, ducks -->

There were cafes, souvenir shops and museums built into a small cottages, which was quite nice. There was a shop that sold warm hot chocolate and stroopwaffels, I bought myself a hot chocolate and some stroopwaffels. The hot chocolate was really needed to warm myself up for that weather.

<!-- Cheese factory photos -->
As we were touring around, we spotted a cheese factory that was not selling different types of cheeses but you can also try samples of them. Again, really warm inside and I mean, unless you're lactose intolerant, who doesn't love cheese? Huh?

<!-- More windmill photos  -->
Right after that, we walked towards the windmills and it started to get really windy and I could feel my lips and ears getting numb due to cold wind. There was a souvenir shop underneath one of those windmills and I just went inside to explore and take some heat until I could move on again :haha:.

<!-- Wooden shoe shop -->
Some of us split up into groups of 4 and began exploring some parts of the village and I spotted this Wooden Shoe Museum and of course, it was free entry, so I went in to take some nice photos and learnt a lot about their history and gained an insight about their culture too.

<!-- Cheese pancake -->
Right after that, it was around 13.30 and I was super hungry and needed to eat something warm. I went inside a nice cafe that served really good crepes with different toppings. I opted for the one that was topped with pineapples and goat cheese. It was hot and boy, it was really delicious. I wish could have more of that but it was quite expensive costing around 12 euros.

We toured around for a bit, took some photos and then decided to head back to the Amsterdam Centraal Station by bus.

### Back to Amsterdam Centraal
<!-- me spinnning around video in centraal -->
Once we reached the station, some of us decided to split up for shopping, visiting a few museums and some decided to head back to the hotel to take some rest. I mean, it was a lot walking for the day, anyways.

I opted to head back to the hotel to take some rest but a few of my colleagues asked me join them as they were going to shop for some souvenirs in the central city. So, I changed my minds and decided to tag along with them.

<!--  Amsterdam centraal at night and more photos  -->

It was around 16.30 and it looked like as if it was night time already but in my opinion, Amsterdam looks really beautiful at night and I decided some more photos as we were walking and hunting for good souvenir shops.

<!-- Fries pics -->

I passed by a shop named "Mannekinpis", which claimed to serve the No.1 fries in Holland and I decided to try it out as my colleagues were busy looking for souvenirs. It's a weekend and there was such a long queue outside the shop but fast moving, so I bought a large sized fries topped with cheese and samuraisauce. It was delicious and one of the best fries I have ever had till date. I guess it did live up to it's name.

<!-- Photos of the city  -->
Then, some of my colleagues suggested if we could go on a canal ride and asked if anyone was interested to join them and I decided to join them. It was about 25 minute walk from the food stall and as we were walking by, I decided to shoot some more photos of the bustling city.

By the time, we reached the canal station, the reservations were full and learnt that we should have booked it in advance of a week. Kind of disappointed, we decided to head back to the hotel by taking a local taxi back to Amsterdam Centraal Station.

<!-- Amsterdama centraal -->
Upon reaching the station, it looked really nice and decided to take some photos before boarding the train to Sloterdijk. It was around 21.35 and I was hungry, so I stopped by the nearest grocery store and bought myself some instant ramen.

<!-- Ramen -->
I reached the hotel, got myself dressed up in my nightwear and warmed up the instant ramen and after sometime, I went to sleep for a few hours as we all have to catch our flight to Dubai that departs at 6.00.

## Day Four: December 4th, 2022

### Amsterdam âœˆ Dubai
Woke up at 1.00, got myself dressed up and all of us assembled at the reception to check-out our rooms and waited for our Uber ride to take us to Schipol airport. On this day, The weather was -1 degree celsius but luckily, we couldn't really feel it much as we were indoors most of the time.

<!-- Airport pics -->
We reached the airport at around 1.45 and waited for some of our colleagues to join us and the gates opened up at 2.00 and all of us checked in our luggages, went through the immigration and security checks and then all of us headed towards the waiting area until the gates opened up.

<!-- Waiting area pics -->

I decided to sit down and re-watch Michael Mann's [Heat](#) (1995) and I still get goosebumps by watching the electrifying performances of both [Robert De Niro](#) and [Al Pacino](#) and it's always one of my favorite movies ever.

<!-- Pictures near the gate -->

The gates opened up at around 5.20 and all of us waited in the long queue and boarded the plane at around 6.00.

### Inside the flight

<!-- flight pics/takeoff -->
Albeit being tired, I was quite awake and decided to take some photos while taking-off and mid-air of the journey. I continued to sleep, stood up for a while and waiting until we touch down in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

### Back to Dubai

<!-- landing video -->

The ending scene from Chris Nolan's [Inception](#) was running in my mind and that when I realized that our trip has come to an end. Honestly, what really made this trip special are the colleagues and the fun memories we had while exploring with each other in Amsterdam, Netherlands and Brussels, Belgium.

We picked up our baggages, said our goodbyes and parted ways to home. Once I reached home, I was happy and committed to myself that I should blog my experiences about this trip or else, I might forget about it :laugh:.

If you've come this far, thank you so much for reading this post and hopefully, you enjoyed reading and had a glimpse of my Europe experiences.

I hope I'll be able to write more longer content like these!

Vaarwel mijn vriend! :handwave:

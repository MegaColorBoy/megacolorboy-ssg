I used to create ISO images using DAEMON Tools but I wanted to try something different and see if there's a way to create it using the Linux CLI.

Turns out, you can do in just a single line using the `dd` utility like so:

<pre>
<code class="bash">
dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/path/to/your/directory/image.iso
</code>
</pre>

The `if` stands for input file and `of` stands for output file.

Looks like, I don't have to use DAEMON Tools for stuff like this, I guess.

Hope you found this tip useful!

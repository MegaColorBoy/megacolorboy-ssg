I was working on a project that dealt with generating large .zip exports and as a result, the `storage/exports` directory, which was used to store all the .zip exports, ended up going all the way up to a whopping size of 10 gigabytes! &#x1F62E;

I resolved it by calling the `Filesystem` package in my controller:
<pre>
<code class="php">
use Illuminate\Filesystem\Filesystem;
</code>
</pre>

Then simply, create a new instance and define the directory you wanted to clear:
<pre>
<code class="php">
$folder = new Filesystem;
$folder->cleanDirectory('storage/exports');
</code>
</pre>

Hope this helps you out!

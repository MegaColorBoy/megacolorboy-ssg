Want to know if a trait is being used in your current class? Try this:
<pre>
<code class="php">
in_array(Foo::class, class_uses($this))
</code>
</pre>

By any chance, if the current class is inherited, please note that the `class_uses()` method will only return the list of traits used by the current class and won't include any traits of it's parent class.

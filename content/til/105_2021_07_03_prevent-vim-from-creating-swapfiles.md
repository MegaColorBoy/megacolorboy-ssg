title: Prevent VIM from creating swapfiles

I like VIM and use it regularly to write and edit code on a daily basis but I always find the creation of `.swp` files really annoying.

If you find them annoying too, you disable them temporarily in the editor, like this:

<pre>
<code class="vim">
:set noswapfile
</code>
</pre>

Or if you want to disable it permanently, just add this line in your `.vimrc` file:
<pre>
<code class="vim">
set noswapfile
</code>
</pre>

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you should dislike `.swp` files because if the editor crashes or your computer/server crashes in midway, those files can save your progress.

Hope you found this tip useful!

If you are using a GUI based application like Microsoft Word of Google Docs, it would be easier for you to know the number of word occurences in a file. But what if you are in a terminal? That's where both `grep` and `wc` comes handy tools.

Let's say you have the following text:

<pre>
<code class="text">
The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary.
</code>
</pre>

Now, you can use the `grep` and `wc` tool to count the number of times `"the"` appears in the file:

<pre>
<code class="bash">
grep -o -i "the" file.txt | wc -l
</code>
</pre>

Hope this helps you out!

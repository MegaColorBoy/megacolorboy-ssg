If you've read my [earlier post](/til/posts/check-ubuntu-version/), I was using Ubuntu, at that time, and I thought that was how you identify which distro is running in your system but using `lsb_release -a` is not always going to work as some distributions may not have it installed.

Try the following command to identify the distribution you are running in your system:

<pre>
<code>
cat /etc/os-release
</code>
</pre>

And you'll get the following output:
<pre>
<code>
NAME="XXXX"
ID="XXXX"
DISTRIB_ID="XXXX"
PRETTY_NAME="XXXX"
</code>
</pre>

Hope this helps you out!

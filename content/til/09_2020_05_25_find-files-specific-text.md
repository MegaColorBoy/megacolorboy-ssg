title: Find files containing specific text

This helped me a lot whenever I'm in a remote server trying to find a keyword or specific text amongst a bunch of files.

This command will save you a lot of time:
<pre>
<code class="bash">
grep -rwn [path] -e 'pattern'
</code>
</pre>

- `r` stands for recursion
- `n` displays the line number
- `w` matches the whole word

Refer to `man find` pages for more info.

Recently, started using Visual Studio Code as I'm yet figure out a way to install Sublime Text on Void Linux (using it as my current daily driver).

I'm always used to looking for my files using keyboard shortcuts in Sublime Text and I was kind of surprised this feature isn't enabled by default in Visual Studio Code.

Anyway, after a little digging, I found out that adding this line to your `settings.json` file would allow you to look for files in your workspace:
<pre>
<code class="json">
"search.useIgnoreFiles": false
</code>
</pre>

And, now try `Ctrl+P` and you'll be able to search for your file(s) easily.

Hope you found this tip useful!

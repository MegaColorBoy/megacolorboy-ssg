Wanted to fetch a specific file from your Git repository except that the repository doesn't exist in your local machine?

Try this out:

<pre>
<code class="bash">
git init
git remote add origin &lt;your_repo_link&gt;.git
git fetch
git checkout &lt;your_branch_name&gt; -- &lt;/path/to/file&gt;
</code>
</pre>

After executing these commands, you should be able to see the selected directory/file in your project directory.

Hope you found this useful!

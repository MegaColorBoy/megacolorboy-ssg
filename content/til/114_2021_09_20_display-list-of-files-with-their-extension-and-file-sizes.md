Last month, I was trying to free up some space in my company servers and I realized that there were a lot of `.zip` files taking up a lot of space.

So, I wrote the following command to list files by their extension:

<pre>
<code class="bash">
find . -iname \*.extension -exec du -sh {} \; &gt; file-list.txt
</code>
</pre>

And later to determine which files are the largest, I executed this command to sort the list by file size:

<pre>
<code class="bash">
sort -rh file-list.txt > newfile.txt
</code>
</pre>

Hope this tip helps you too! &#x1F604;

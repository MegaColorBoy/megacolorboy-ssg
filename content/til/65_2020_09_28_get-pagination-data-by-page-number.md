By default, Laravel's paginator checks the value of the page based on the query string and uses that to display the results and also, it generates links to previous and next pages as well.

The `paginate()` method takes the following parameters by default:
```php
public function paginate($perPage = null, $columns = ['*'], $pageName = 'page', $page = null);
```

So, if you want to fetch the pagination data of a specific page, then just write this:
```php
$pageNumber = 5;
$data = ExampleModel::paginate(5, ['*'], 'page', $pageNumber);
```

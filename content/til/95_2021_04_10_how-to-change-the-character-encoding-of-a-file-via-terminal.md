Sometimes, I face character encoding issues while making minor edits via a SFTP console connected to a Linux server. I found a quick hack to change the file encoding using `vim` on the command line.

In this example, I'm changing the encoding of the file to `unix`:

```bash
vim $filename +"set ff=unix" +wq
```

Hope you found this helpful!

Few days back, I ran a `wget` command to download a file and accidentally closed the SSH client.

I logged in again and checked the list of active processes and thankfully, the `wget` process was still running except that I wasn't able to know the current progress of it.

So, I did a little research and found a way to view the progress, so I tried the following command:
<pre>
<code class="bash">
tail -f wget_log
</code>
</pre>

And, I was able to view it's current download progress again.

Hope this helps you out!

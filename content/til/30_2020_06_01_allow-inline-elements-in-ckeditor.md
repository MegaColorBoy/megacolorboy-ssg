Using CKEditor is awesome but I hate it when it removes inline elements like `<span>`, `<i>` or any DOM elements that contain attributes like classnames or ID, by default.

Well, CKEditor's [documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_allowed_content_rules.html) states that you can allow it by adding this line to your configuration:
<pre>
<code class="js">
var editor = CKEDITOR.replace('textarea_edit',{
    allowedContent: true,
});
</code>
</pre>
After adding this line, CKEditor will stop removing those elements from your HTML content but it's also open to all tags. 

You can set rules to allow only specific ones like this:
<pre>
<code class="js">
var editor = CKEDITOR.replace('textarea_edit',{
    allowedContent: 'span; i; ul; li; a[!href]'
});
</code>
</pre>
Hope this helps you out! &#x1F60A;

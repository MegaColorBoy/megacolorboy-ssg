I thought of getting back into competitive programming again and 
started practicing my python coding-chops on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

Here's a neat trick on how to extract unique characters from a string:

<pre>
<code class="python">
from collections import OrderedDict

word = "HelloWorld"
uniq = ''.join(OrderedDict.fromkeys(word).keys())

print(uniq) # prints HeloWrd
</code>
</pre>

Using `OrderedDict` allows you to preserve the order in which the keys are inserted as a normal `dict` doesn't track the order.

Hope you found this useful!

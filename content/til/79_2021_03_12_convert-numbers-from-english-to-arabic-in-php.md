If you're a developer working in the Middle East, it's quite common that you'll work on a project that bilingual, in our case, it's english and arabic.

In my opinion, it's not aesthetically pleasing and logical to have english numbers in arabic text, so, write a simple helper function to convert the numerals from english to arabic:

<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;php
    function convertEnglishToArabicNumerals($str) {
        if (\App::getLocale() == 'ar') {
            $westernArabic = array('0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9');
            $easternArabic = array('٠', '١', '٢', '٣', '٤', '٥', '٦', '٧', '٨', '٩');
            $str = str_replace($westernArabic, $easternArabic, $str);
        }
        return $str;
    }
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>

And since most browsers can handle RTL, you don't have to worry about how the arabic numerals are being displayed in your application.

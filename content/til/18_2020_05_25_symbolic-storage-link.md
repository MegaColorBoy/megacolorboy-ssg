When using Laravel, the `public` directory is used for files that are publicly accessible. By default, it's stored in `local` and often stored in this `storage/app/public` directory. You can make it easily accessible by using the following command:

<pre>
<code class="bash">
php artisan storage:link
</code>
</pre>

Once, it has been created, you can use access those files using the `public_path` or `asset` methods.

<pre>
<code class="php">
echo public_path('images/sample_1.jpg');
echo asset('images/sample_2.jpg');
</code>
</pre>

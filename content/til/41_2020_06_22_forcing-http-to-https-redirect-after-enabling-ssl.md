You can manually force HTTP to HTTPS after enabling your SSL certificate by adding the following condition at the beginning of your `.htaccess` file in your `public` directory:
<pre>
<code>
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forward-Proto} !=https
RewriteRule .* https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
</code>
</pre>
Save your file and restart your Apache server and now, your web application will redirect all your users to `https://` instead of `http://` URLs in the future.
